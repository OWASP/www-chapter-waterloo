**Meetup 2021-01**

**Welcome to OWASP Waterloo** 

This is our first meetup of 2021! 
We are excited to meet everyone and since this is the first OWASP waterloo meetup of 2021, will begin with an introduction, followed by a presentation and discussion. 

**A Journey through the Kubernetes Threat Matrix**

**Summary:**

In this presentation we explore a Kubernetes Threat Matrix and the impact that a vulnerable application has on a poorly configured cluster. This talk draws from examples of teams that rush in to adopt Kubernetes without consideration for security guidance and best practices. In our example, a devops engineer deploys a vulnerable legacy application to an internet facing cluster and decides to use the Kubernetes CA for internal TLS certificates as an easy option since it is available and trusted in the cluster. As we journey through the Kubernetes threat matrix, we demonstrate how an attacker might take advantage of the vulnerable container and cluster misconfiguration for profit. The focus of this talk is to explore threats in Kubernetes and discuss security misconfigurations from the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)

**Presenters:**
Scott Handfield,
Kris Jamieson,
Deepak Sharma

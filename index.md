**Meetup 2021-03**
*NOTE: New date for meetup*

Date / Time: Dec 2, 2021 @ 7:30 PM  <br>
Location: Virtual (Link provided in Meetup) 

We are trilled to have a guest speaker and recent member join us in a look back at lessons learned running a security champions program.  

Almost a year ago Connor delivered a talk on what it took to create a security champions program from scratch. Now he is here to share what he has learned over the last year and answer outstanding questions. If you haven’t yet seen the original talk you should give it a once over, you can find it here [OWASP Toronto - November 2020 Double Talk Event - Security Champions and Intro to Threat Modeling.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fnEy1q0TZ0)

In this presentation we are going to quickly recap how to establish a program before diving right into how to improve your training, boost retention, and measure success. At the end of this discussion everyone should have a better understanding of how to better lead and measure a security champions program.

SPEAKER BIO

My name is Connor McKinnon, and I am the Engineering Manager for Platform Security at Wealthsimple. In my role, I have been very fortunate to have helped grow our organization by 10x in just the last 2 years, and I am looking forward to continuing to grow our amazing teams. 

My team is made up of software engineers using code to solve security problems. I have often described us as “boots on the ground” for the security organization. If there is a problem that needs solving and off the shelf components won’t cut it, we are the team that gets tasked with finding a solution.

In my last role as Team Lead for the Application Security Team at Wealthsimple, I had the privilege of creating our wildly successful Security Champions program which continues to run to this day. Currently, I am working on developing solutions for a distributed authorization layer that makes security easy and improves the developer experience.

In my spare time I am an avid reader. Recently, I challenged myself to see how many books I could read in just two months and am pleased to report I tapped out at 17. I am always looking for suggestions as well! Please feel free to DM me your favorites :D
